\begin{abstract}
This report summarizes the works which have been presented by the Intelligent Systems Research Institute of Sungkyunkwan University to the community of artificial intelligence and robotics. Five relevant articles published by the Institute during 2015 to 2018 are reviewed in order to exhibit the research progress made on cognitive capabilities of service robots. The Major Line Extraction algorithm has been proposed to exploit line features of the environments. This novel algorithm exhibits an improvement on extracting cursive lines with less discontinuities. Experimental results have shown that the algorithm outperforms a well-known method called the Line Segment Detector. Additionally, the Covariance Projection Filtering is a sensor filtering framework proposed for distributed sensory systems. The framework generalizes a filtering model for Gaussian linear systems. Comparing with Kalman filters, it provides an additional step for detecting data anomalies. For indoor environments, Wi-Fi fingerprints are of available landmarks for localizing robot positions. A new approach has been proposed based on the concept of "invariant received signal length statistics" that is able to overcome the instability of Wi-Fi signals. Experimental results show that this new method provides higher performance by 17\% in terms of success rate. For object detection, a new method has been proposed for detecting industrial objects with less textures. The method employees model-based point cloud matching within an adaptive Bayesian framework. Experiments show that such an approach achieves over 97.5\% of recognition rate. Later, a deep neural network has been integrated into such a framework. It adopts a Convolutional Neural Network based feature extraction and reconstruction model to handle a larger number of objects without performance degeneration. It turns out that such a method allows the number of objects and their categories to be extended by 10 and 5 times, respectively.

\section{Major Line Extraction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\subsection{Summary}
The novelty of the proposed method lies in the framework
of recruiting major lines from the maximally generated zero
threshold Canny edge links with the Sobel highlights as a guide
for recruitment. This makes it easier not only for representing
lines as a whole in terms of connected edge clusters but also
for tracing cursive lines of a higher curvature along Sobel highlights, resulting in a better way of incorporating a wider scope of
global context and of optimizing the sensitivity and robustness
trade-off.

\subsection{Methodology}
To obtain the Sobel highlights from
an input image, $I_0$, and its min-max normalized Sobel image, $I_s$,
first, at each pixel, a $3\times n$ oblong shape mask is defined along the
direction of its Sobel edge orientation with the pixel at the center,
as shown in Figure \ref{oblong}

\Figure[t!](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt){oblong.png}
{An oblong shape mask placed for a pixel.\label{oblong}}.

Major lines tend
to have their lengths sufficiently long. The longer the length,
the better the chance of the edge link is being a major line. The
length index, $w_l$, is defined by
\begin{equation}
w_l=log_N(number\ of\ the\ pixels\ of\ a\ link).
\end{equation}

The above three indices, $w_c$, $w_a$, and $w_l$, quantifying for the
potential of a zero-threshold Canny edge link as a major line,
are now combined into a single index, $w$, referred to here as the
recruitment index, as follows:
\begin{equation}
w=w_{l}w_{c}^{\alpha}w_{\alpha}^{\beta},
\end{equation}
where the parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, are to be used for setting the
relative significance between $w_c$ and $w_a$.

Finally, a zero-threshold Canny edge link is selected as a
major line, if the recruitment index, $w$, is larger than the pre-set
threshold. Note that, in this letter, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both set as 0.5 as
the default values and the recruitment index threshold is set as
1.0. For more detailed flow of the proposed algorithm, refer to
the following pseudo-code.

\section{The Covariance Projection Framework}
\subsection{Summary}
The proposed method, referred to here as the Covariance Projection (CP) method, provides an
unbiased and optimal solution in the sense of minimum mean square error (MMSE), if the projection
is based on the minimum weighted distance on the constraint manifold. The proposed method
not only offers a generalization of the conventional formula for handling constraints and data
inconsistency, but also provides a new insight into data fusion in terms of a geometric-algebraic
point of view.
\subsection{Methodology}
he proposed method first represents the probability of true states and measurements in the
extended space around the data from state predictions and sensor measurements, where the extended
space is formed by taking states and measurements as independent variables. Any constraints among
true states and measurements that should be satisfied are then represented as a constraint manifold
in the extended space. This is shown schematically in Figure \ref{cpf_manifold} for filtering as an example. Data fusion is accomplished by projecting the probability distribution of true states
and measurements onto the constraint manifold.

%\Figure[t!](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt){cpf_manifold.png}
%{Probability of true states and measurements in the extended space around the data from
%state predictions and sensor measurements and constraint manifold.\label{cpf_manifold}}

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering 
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{cpf_manifold.png}
  \caption{Probability of true states and measurements in the extended space.}
  \label{cpf_manifold}
\end{figure}

More specifically, consider two mean estimates, $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$, of the state $x\in \mathbb{R}^N$, with their
respective covariances as $P_1, P_1\in \mathbb{R}^N\times N$. Furthermore, the estimates are assumed to be correlated with
cross-covariance $P_{12}$. The mean estimates and their covariances together with their cross-covariance in
$\mathbb{R}^N$ are then transformed to an extended space of $\mathbb{R}^{2N}$ along with the linear constraint between the two estimates:
\begin{equation}
\hat{x}=\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{x}_1 \\ \hat{x}_2
\end{bmatrix},\ P=\begin{bmatrix}
P_1 & P_{12} \\ P_{12}^T & P_2
\end{bmatrix},\ C_1\hat{x}_1=C_2\hat{x}_2
\end{equation}

To find a point on the constraint manifold with minimum weighted distance, we apply the whitening transform (WT) defined as, $W=D^{-1/2}E^T$, where $D$ and $E$ are the eigenvalue and eigenvector matrices of $P$. Applying WT,
\begin{equation}
\hat{x}^W=W\hat{x},\ P^W=WPW^T,\ M^W=WM
\end{equation}

where the matrix $M = [C1 C2]^T$ is the subspace of the constraint manifold. The probability
distribution is then orthogonally projected on the transformed manifold $M^W$ to satisfy the constraints
between the data sources in the transformed space. Inverse WT is applied to
obtain the fused mean estimate and covariance in the original space,
\begin{equation}
\label{xwprw}
\tilde{x}=W^{-1}P_r W\hat{x}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{pwprprtwt}
\tilde{P}=W^{-1}P_r P_{r}^{T}W^{-T}
\end{equation}
where $P_r=M^W(M^{W^T}M^W)^{-1}M^{W^T}$ is the orthogonal projection matrix. Using the definition of various
components in (\ref{xwprw}) and (\ref{pwprprtwt}), a close form simplification can be obtained as,
\begin{equation}
\label{xmmtpmmtpx}
\tilde{x}=M(M^TP^{-1}M)^{-1}M^TP^{-1}\hat{x}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{pmmtpmmt}
\tilde{P}=M(M^TP^{-1}M)^{-1}M^T
\end{equation}

Due to the projection in extended space of $\mathbb{R}^{2N}$, (\ref{xmmtpmmtpx}) and (\ref{pmmtpmmt}) provide a fused result with respect to each data source. In the case of where $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$ estimate the same entity, that is, $M=[I_N I_N]^T$, the fused result will be same for the two data sources. As such, a close form equation for fusing redundant data sources in $\mathbb{R}^N$ can be obtained from (\ref{xmmtpmmtpx}) and (\ref{pmmtpmmt}) as,
\begin{equation}
\tilde{x}=(M^TP^{-1}M)^{-1}M^TP^{-1}\hat{x}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\tilde{P}=(M^TP^{-1}M)^{-1}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Results}
The simulation is carried out for 1000 Monte Carlo runs and the local estimates provided by four
sensor nodes along with the fused result of the CP method are shown in Figure \ref{cpf_result_image}. The straight lines
in Figure \ref{cpf_result_image} denote the trace of error covariance matrices and the solid curve represents the MSE of
local and fused estimates. It can be observed from Figure \ref{cpf_result_image} that the MSE of the individual sensor node fluctuates around the trace. Furthermore, the accuracy relation of
local sensor estimates and fused estimates in terms of MSE in Figure \ref{cpf_result_image} is coincident with the
theoretical result in Table \ref{cpf_result_table}.
